# Toolkit

This is a utility repository containing tools needed for
building various C libraries on Windows systems. It is
meant only for my own purposes and is not expected to be
useful for anyone else.

## How to use

Clone the repository and run `activate.cmd`.
This will add the appropriate directories to `PATH`.

Then you can use whatever tools are included.
